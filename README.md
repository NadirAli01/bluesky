This was a framework that was originally created by Alzar & DiscworldZA for Blue Sky roleplay, it was later retooled for PixelWorldRP which then later rebranded to React RP.

As the original authors, Discworld & Alzar had worked out an agreement for use of this framework on PixelWorld/ReactRP prior to DiscworldZA joining that team. At no point was ownership ever transferred to PixelWorld/ReactRP.

This code is being released as-is with no guarantee of working out of the box. In fact it will not work without extensive decoupling from a custom Invision Power Board application that was written for Blue Sky.
